### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**aPn23/aPn23** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an employee portal for my work.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, and SQLDatabase
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating an employee portal for our company to aid in communication and content access.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. Networking and connecting with new people helps me grow personally and improves my skills in many aspects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am Polish and was born in Poland. I live in the States for over 20 years now. I am a training specialist for a German company and part of my duties is to improve the onboarding process for all of our new technicians. I hope that learning new web design and creating skills will aid me in making it easier to onboard our technicians. -->
